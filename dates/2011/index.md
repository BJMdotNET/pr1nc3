These are the original members of the Time, the band Prince put together in 1981 but won't give permission to use the name by which they are best known because Symbolina owns the rights to it. After the group autographed copies of their new CD "Condensate" at the Mall of America for some of their most longtime, devoted fans, Jimmy Jam talked with me about more pleasant matters. A sports fan and former Wolves courtside season ticket holder, he says something that may have jittery Vikings fans praying from "Jimmy's lips to Zygi's ears.""**](https://www.startribune.com/jimmy-jam-he-loves-california-misses-nice/133747358/)
