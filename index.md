## Links to articles grouped by:

  * [publications](./publications/index.md)
  * [authors](./authors/index.md)
  * [dates](./dates/index.md)
  * [topics](./topics/index.md)

## Notes:
  * There are approximately 1793 links.
  * Some links might be duplicates, e.g. some AP News articles are linked through multiple links.
  * Some articles might be duplicated, usually because for instance an AP News article is republished elsewhere.
     * I try to avoid including such republished articles, but it's likely I've missed some instances.
  * Not all links are active anymore.
     * At the bottom of each entry is a link -- "(mirror)" -- to find the article in the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.
        * there is no guarantee the article is available there.
  * Apologies to the authors who are not mentioned in an article's overview: adding authors is a separate, manual and time-consuming step.
  * For some sites I have managed to automate the conversion from link -> html file -> database entry.
     * But even in those cases I need to check the result, which is time-consuming.
  * An article's list of topics might be incomplete and/or incorrect.
  * Topics might appear multiple times, for instance due to typographical differences.
  * The "global search" at the top can be useful, but it only searches the contents of this site (and even this is limited).
  * This site is barely in 'beta'. Keep your expectations low.
  * Unfortunately, you cannot contribute. I know there are tons of links 'missing', but it is what it is. 
     * Building a public back-end would unfortunately take far too much effort and time, which I don't have.
