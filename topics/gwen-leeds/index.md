 - [**"PRINCE AND THE REVOLUTION: BEHIND THE PURPLE ROPE -- Having established his heavyweight status as James Brown’s tour manager, Alan Leeds was brought on midway through Prince’s 1999 tour as a freelance replacement. After finding his niche within the sometimes peculiar Prince entourage, Alan and his wife Gwen moved to Minneapolis to work for the artist full time. Little did they know, they were about to witness some of the greatest years in the history of popular music, as Prince and the Revolution busted out with the groundbreaking album and film Purple Rain."**](https://www.waxpoetics.com/connections/prince/article/prince-and-the-revolution/)
