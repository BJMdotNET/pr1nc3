 - [**"Q&A with C.J.: Lee Hawkins, journalist and songwriter -- Wall Street Journal reporter and Minnesota native Lee Hawkins' "I Love You Woman" was Grand Prize winner in the R&B category of the 2011 John Lennon Songwriting Contest. Winning the contest "prompted me to release a few songs from my catalogue on iTunes under the title 'Midnight Conversations,'" he told me. Hawkins writes, sings and hosts "The Business of Celebrity with Lee Hawkins" on YouTube. It's the kind of smart family content that Magic Johnson mused about while being interviewed for the show -- programming that the NBA Hall of Famer and businessman would like to see on his new network, "Aspire." On rare occasions, Hawkins is able to integrate journalism and singing, as he did in an interview (startribune.com/a1511) with boxer Manny Pacquiao. "Reporters had been asking Manny to sing all day as part of his [Timothy] Bradley-Pacquiao fight, but I was the only reporter who was willing to sing with him. He kept telling everybody 'No' but when I started singing with him, the fun began." The results are charming, even though neither Pacquiao nor Hawkins can fully recall the lyrics to Lennon's "Imagine." Still, it's "one example of how being a musician helps me with my guests," said Hawkins. I conducted this Q&A with him via e-mail and was left with the impression he'd like to interview with Katie Couric."**](https://www.startribune.com/q-a-with-c-j-lee-hawkins-journalist-and-songwriter/162446386/)
